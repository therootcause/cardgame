Deck of Cards 
- Using the deck of cards API (http://deckofcardsapi.com)
- allow a user to draw a card from a single deck. 
- Based on the drawing, the program should keep a running count in a list of the value of the card (ignoring the suit or color). 
- Once the round is over, the user should be prompted to pull another card from the deck or to reshuffle the deck and start again. 
- Bonus 1 - The final list should be ordered in the rank of the deck starting with Ace, 2, 3, … Queen, King. 
- Bonus 2 - Once the deck is created, store the deck_id as well as the running tally so that the next time a person can pick up from where they left off.
Ex. A user selects Jack, Queen and 2 5’s. The result of the list should be {Jack:1, Queen:2, 5:2}
